# Wordplay

This is my first React game.

## Description

The game is endless, fetches words, one by one, from an API and allows the user to guess them.

*Inspect the page to see the word*

## Instructions
1. You've got 5 chances to guess the unknown word
2. Start by typing the word and press the Enter key to submit your guess
3. If the letter you typed is part of the word it will be displayed on a yellow background
4. If the letter you typed is part of the word and is in the correct position it will be displayed on a green background

**Note: There is no autocompletion on doubled letters**

## How to run

### run `npm install`
### run `npm start`
